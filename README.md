## Introduction

**Score Keeper** is a simple React application designed to track scores for multiple players. Each player starts with a score of 1, and users can increase their scores by pressing a "+1" button. The app features a reset button to set all scores back to 0. A player wins when their score reaches 5. The total number of players and the target score can be adjusted through component props, although the user interface for these features has not been implemented yet.
